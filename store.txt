I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well being

Man's not hot, never hot

Minus one that's three, quick maths
Everyday man's on the block
Smoke trees (Ah)

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

Tides that I tried to swim against

Oh, I beg, I beg and plead
Singin' come out of things un said

Bow your head, they're pious here

Our own room, no bias here

The Spouter-Inn

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little
or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore,
I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.
3
Stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm,
and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto,
I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in December."
3
Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,
low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots,
reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.
